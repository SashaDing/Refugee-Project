      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>We aim to provide a platform for refugees arriving in Scotland which can help with integration and everyday life. Through our open events and mentor program we strongly encourage solidarity and underline that they way forward for humanity is building bridges. You will also find updated information regarding the refugee crisis and current refugee initiatives in Scotland. Refugee Action Scotland (RAS) was started as a response to the plight of refugees and migrants in the UK and across Europe. We aim to show solidarity with people uprooted from their homes for whichever reason, be it war or economic hardship, through creating a platform where people can come together to support each other. We assist refugees arriving in Scotland through events, practical help and our mentorship program.

      <h3>The Crisis</h3>
      <p>The European refugee crisis began in 2015 when a rising number of people arrived undocumented in the European Union (EU), traveling across the Mediterranean Sea or overland through Southeast Europe. The unauthorized foreign migrants came mostly from Muslim-majority countries of regions south and east of Europe, including Western Asia, South Asia, and Africa. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the top three nationalities of entrants of the over one million Mediterranean Sea arrivals between January 2015 and March 2016 were Syrian (46.7%), Afghan (20.9%) and Iraqi (9.4%). </p>
      
      <p>Since April 2015, the European Union has struggled to cope with the crisis, increasing funding for border patrol operations in the Mediterranean, devising plans to fight migrant smuggling, launching Operation Sophia and proposing a new quota system both to relocate asylum seekers among EU states for processing of refugee claims to alleviate the burden on countries on the outer borders of the Union, and to resettle asylum-seekers who have been determined to be genuine refugees. Individual countries have at times reintroduced border controls within the Schengen Area, and rifts have emerged between countries willing to allow entry of asylum-seekers for processing of refugee claims and others countries trying to discourage their entry for processing.</p>
      
      <p>Several serious accidents and deaths have occurred in Europe as a result of migrant smuggling, both in the Mediterranean Sea, due to the capsizing of crowded and unseaworthy migrant vessels, and on European soil, due to the use of standard cargo trucks by smugglers to transport migrants. The vast majority of deaths occurred while persons were being illegally smuggled across the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, and spiked at 5000 death at the end of 2016 according to UNHCR.</p>
